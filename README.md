# Hidden Markov ModelS

Hello Dr. Wang! This is a simulation of the Hidden Markov Model as it is applied in the field of automated speech recognition. The model accepts a String sequence of observations of vocabulary {"1", "2", "3"} and computes the probability of observation sequences (likelihoods) and then decodes the input to produce the hidden state sequence.

This software uses the [Google Guava library](http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/) version 13.0.1.

## Installation

*	Simply clone the master branch as follows: 
	```
	git clone -b `master` https://github.com/dvijayak/HiddenMarkovModel.git
	```
	### OR
	Download a ZIP archive of the source from [here](https://github.com/dvijayak/HiddenMarkovModel)
	
*	Compile and Run as follows:
	```
	javac -d bin -sourcepath src -cp libs/guava-13.0.1.jar src/markov/HiddenMarkovModel.java
	java -cp bin;libs/guava-13.0.1.jar markov.HiddenMarkovModel
	```

## Optional Command-Line Arguments:
### ATTENTION: COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS ARE BROKEN AT THE MOMENT - SORRY!
The program accepts the input sequence from `stdin`. You also have the option of inputing the String as a command-line argument 
For example:
```
java -cp bin;libs/guava-13.0.1.jar markov.HiddenMarkovModel 3133132
```
	
## Caution

PLEASE only use the vocabulary {"1", "2", "3"}. The model does not reject observations that do not exist in the vocabulary YET. Your application will crash if you do not heed this warning.

# Thank you!
